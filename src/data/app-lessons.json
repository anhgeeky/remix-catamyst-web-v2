        "html": "<p>Welcome aboard! It's a good time to learn.</p><p>But first, take our time to understand how we're going to learn here.</p><h1>Learning Structure</h1><p>In Catamyst, learning and practicing are bundled together with this structure:</p><ul><li><strong>Track</strong>: The learning roadmaps which you can choose based on your interest. Everything starts from the very beginning, continuing up to more challenging ones. Each Track contains several Topics that already in order.</li><li><strong>Topic</strong>: The subjects that are nicely arranged based on the track. Each Topic contains multiple Lessons that are grouped. Topics are also categorized based on the similarities or discipline with other topics such as Preparation, General, Frontend, Backend, Career, and Special.</li><li><strong>Lesson</strong>: The actual materials from which you can learn. It could contain texts to read, images to see, videos to watch, links to visit, demos to try, activities to enjoy, projects to practice, tutorials to follow, problems to solve, cases to analyze, design to interact, source code to work on, and other references to learn more. Feel free to use the provided materials based on your preference in learning.</li></ul><p>Most of the lessons are given in text format because that is the primary format of resources you're going to get in a real-world situation. Also, it's a lot faster to read and copy from the text than from videos.</p><p>You can also notice that in every <strong>Topic</strong> and <strong>Lesson</strong>, there are navigation buttons to either go to the previous or the next one.</p><p>Here you are actually free to start almost anywhere or jump between different topics and lessons as you wish. But recommend you to follow through from the very beginning, sequentially, unless you already know what you're doing by yourself.</p><h1>Lesson Category</h1><p>Each lesson has its category:</p><ul><li><strong>Fundamental</strong>: Mostly theories or very important things you need to understand at first before moving into something more specific or going into a practical project.</li><li><strong>Specific</strong>: Mostly implementations or what are the specific tools or technologies to choose. Then how they are useful in a project.</li><li><strong>Project</strong>: Practical activity to build something that applies both the fundamental knowledge and specific skill. The scale could vary betweens Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, and Huge.</li></ul><h1>Lesson Level</h1><p>Each lesson also has its level:</p><ul><li><strong>Newbie</strong></li><li><strong>Beginner</strong></li><li><strong>Intermediate</strong></li><li><strong>Advanced</strong></li><li><strong>Expert</strong></li></ul><p>They are what they are, just like in a game, or real-life references. If you're just getting started in learning the chosen track, you would start from Newbie level lessons. If you already had prior experience, you might continue from either Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, or Expert level.</p><p>Currently, the Newbie lessons are the only free lessons, that even you can access directly without signing up. If you want to access beyond that, then you have to sign up for an account, then upgrade to the Pro plan.</p><h1>Your Contents</h1><p>Since Catamyst is an all-in-one platform, you can do these other than just learning if you created an account:</p><ol><li>Profile that can be used for your homepage or resume. Just like Twitter, Instagram, or LinkedIn.</li><li>Publish projects as your portfolio to prove your knowledge or work experience.</li><li>Create discussions or ask and answer questions with the other community members.</li><li>Get a dedicated experienced mentor to help you directly, live 1-on-1 privately, with a customized schedule (This requires you to enroll in <alink href='/pricing'>Super plan</alink>).</li><li>Apply for jobs, either full-time or freelance. Or if you are an employer from a company, you can also post a job vacancy (This requires you to subscribe for a <alink href='/pricing'>Pro plan</alink>).</li></ol><p>Alright, that's all you have to know to start. Please enjoy the journey!</p>"
