# Catamyst Super guide for learners

Hi there!

If you are interested in learning more about technology, design, code, and programming — with mentorship — this is for you.

We help you as a learner to achieve one or more of these:

- Proficiency in science, technology, engineering, arts, languages, and mathematics.
- Ability to craft interesting creations or projects.
- Ability to design or code websites.
- Ability to implement the design or code of web applications.
- Publish projects and gain a real-world portfolio.
- Upgrade skill-set in school or the workforce.
- Change career into tech, software, or IT industry.
- Get friendly mentorship or training from experienced developers who can teach.

(If you are a parent, you can also help your kids achieve them.)

You just need to have:

- Interest to learn
- Long-term patience
- Good attitude

Yes, you don't need a previous technical background. This is perfect for beginners.

## Activities

What can we do together?

Catamyst can do these for you:

- Helping you with the whole process of preparation, learning, until graduation.
- Mentoring or training you until you are capable.
- Contributing to the technical development (design, code, etc) of your projects.
- Managing your projects for the long-term.
- Promoting and mediating you to employers who can hire you.
- Becoming your friend :)

Think of it like we're the principal and teachers of a school, but much more casual.

You're going to do these by:

- Telling about yourself and your expectations.
- Communicating with the mentor frequently and the other learners.
- Learning and practicing the lessons, when progressing with and without a mentor.
- Making, designing, developing, and publishing your creations or projects for portfolio.
- Building your personal brand and updating your resume (if needed).
- Applying for a job, or accepting freelance offers (if needed).
- Paying the tuition before the program starts.

## Lessons

What can you learn?

A lot! And depends on your interest.

You can already see in the <NextLink href="/learn" passHref><Link color="teal.500">Learn page</Link></NextLink> for the choice of tracks and lessons.
