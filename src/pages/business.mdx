# Catamyst Business service guide

Hi there, this is Catamyst Business.

Your business might need a developer. Or need more developers. Or upgrading the existing developers. Or maintaining an existing system. Or even building new software.

If you're interested to do so with our help — this is for you.

Catamyst is empowering businesses to become better at software development, publishing web apps, and working with developers. All in one.

This is for you, the employer in form of organization, company, or individual, who want to partner or collaborate on:

- Mentorship
- Training
- Scholarship
- Recruitment

To send the request, please read the details first then fill out the form below. Before continuing, you should be prepared with a budget of a minimum around USD 1000–2000.

## Services

We (as the vendor) offer you to:

- Help with the whole process of preparation, work, and release.
- Promote your organization/company.
- Find, recruit, and filter the candidates/developers.
- Mediate between candidates and you.
- Mentor or train the candidates.
- Contribute to the technical software development (architecture, design, code, infrastructure, etc).
- Manage the project/product (if any).

You (as the client) just need to:

- Inform your identity and expectations (goals, scope, requirements, timeline, budget, etc).
- Pay Catamyst for the service before and during the program. Give stipend (if any) to the candidates/developers.
- Review the process, progress, and result.
- Hire the candidates to work with you (if required).

## Cost

The base cost:

- USD 1500–2000/person for training, mentorship, or scholarship.
- USD 500–1000/person for recruitment only without training/mentorship.

If your currency is not USD, don't worry, we'll help you convert it.

The cost itself is adaptable depending on how many people are required and involved.

# Process

The whole process has 3 phase:

1. Preparation: Administrative tasks before the work.
2. Work: The actual activities to be done.
3. Release: The end of the program and final handover.

## Preparation

1. Catamyst and employers (organization/company/individual) know and understand each other from somewhere.
   - Websites, social media, or connections.
2. The identity or request form is filled by you.
   - <LinkButton
       size="sm"
       href="/business/form"
       leftIcon={<Icon name="form" />}
       colorScheme="green"
     >
       Fill the Business form
     </LinkButton>
3. The initial discussion can be done via email.
   - No phone call or video meeting yet. Most of the initial information should be written in text. It saves a lot of time to think and carefully exchange the initial information.
4. The ongoing discussion is taken further about more internal details and the business deal.
   - After enough information, a video meeting can be done.
   - Either Catamyst or you can schedule and invite for a live meeting session.
5. The draft for the proposal is being written and reviewed until the final proposal or partnership offer is accepted.
   - Multiple information from both business and technical sides such as goals, scopes, requirements, stack, expertise, timeline, schedule, legal, budget, allowance, and others.
   - Success and failure criteria, or so called best and worst-case scenarios.
   - Payment method and schema.
     - 1st payment before the work is started. Around 20%–50% of the total, depending on the scope for the initial work.
     - 2nd payment during the work is running. Around 80%–50% of the total.
     - Payment can be done through your settings, direct bank transfer, or cryptocurrency (such as USDT, Bitcoin, Ethereum).
   - Terms and conditions.
     - Rules of work.
     - Continuity of work.
     - Cancellation of work.
   - Statements and signatures.
6. The representatives from Catamyst and yours sign the proposal, contract, or cooperation agreement.
7. The 1st payment is sent to Catamyst.
8. The initial **Work** phase can begin.

## Work

There are two different timelines or milestones, with each could correspond for business-side or technical-side.

1. The finding or recruiting the candidates (developers/designers).
   - This is needed if there are no existing candidates/developers.
   - The timeline is around 1–2 months or more.
   - The main method is promoting through multiple channels: websites, social media, direct network or connections. Ads is possible but should prioritize organic reach.
   - After this phase is over, the 2nd payment has to be made before continuing with the candidates.
2. The running of the program (mentorship/training) and/or developing the applications.
   - This is not needed for recruitment-only service.
   - The timeline is around 1–2 months or more.
   - The main method is combining the software development and the training/mentorship with the candidates/developers.
   - The stipend can be given directly to the candidates/developers. From you, not through Catamyst.
   - The direct involvement by you and your representatives can be around 10% to 50%.
   - After this phase is over, the **Release** phase can begin.

Both timelines can have the progress presented and reviewed. Preferably once every 2 to 4 weeks, so-called sprints (a set period of time during which specific tasks must be completed, but not strict like in Scrum).

### Business-side

1. The agreement for the candidates is prepared.
2. The promotional campaign is prepared.
   - Hook (appealing offer) and briefs (goal, specifications)
   - Benefits (experience, portfolio, stipend)
   - Requirements (skill, technology, stack, system)
   - Contact (submission form)
3. The campaigns are shared across different places.
   - Blog or media post
   - Social media poster
   - Community groups
4. The candidates are:
   - Filtered
   - Reviewed
   - Followed up and given an extra test for eligibility
   - Interviewed (preferably by Catamyst team, with you or your representatives)
   - Accepted
5. The progress is presented and reviewed.
   - Preferably once every 2 to 4 weeks.
6. (For scholarship) The candidates are offered and signed the agreement.
7. The candidates are accepted as students, mentees, developers, designers, or team members.

### Technical-side

1. The complete business process and technical requirements are gathered and decided.
   - Data flow, structure, schema, table.
   - Communication and management tools such as Telegram, Trello, Jira, Asana, Basecamp, Rock, or Slack. We prefer Rock as it replaces everything else.
2. The user journey and UI/UX are designed.
   - Design tools such as Figma, Framer, Adobe XD, or Miro. We prefer Figma.
   - Brand and design system (if any).
   - Content and copywriting.
   - Wireframe, mockup, or prototype.
3. The documentation, system, and application are being decided, written, developed, tested, deployed, and reviewed. We prefer all of these.
   - General stack such as Git, Markdown, REST API, GraphQL API, WebSocket (usually via Socket.io), and testing library/suite (including static analysis ESLint).
   - Frontend stack such as JavaScript/TypeScript, React, React Router, Next.js, Redux, emotion/styled-components, Tailwind, Chakra UI, Storybook.js, SWR, axios, or urql.
     - We don't prefer Vue, Angular, or Svelte.
   - Backend stack such as JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, RethinkDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Prisma, Nexus, Apollo, or Supabase.
     - We also prefer Python, Ruby, Golang, and Elixir; but currently they're not our focus.
     - We don't prefer PHP and Java, unless just communicating via API.
     - Alternatives for CMS-specific such as Strapi, Sanity, or Dato CMS can be used depending on the requirements.
   - Deployment stack such as Vercel, Supabase, Firebase, Heroku, Railway, VPS (Virtual Private Server), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS).
     - We recommend incremental deploy in that order from the simplest to the most complex.
     - We don't prefer Microsoft Azure and Alibaba Cloud.
     - We might not need Docker and Kubernetes yet, depending on the software complexity.
   - Other tools such as GitHub for code collaboration, Sentry for application monitoring and error tracking, GitHub Actions or Circle CI for CI/CD, Stripe/PayPal/local platform for payment gateway.
     - We also prefer Bitbucket, GitLab, Gitlab-CI, Travis CI.
4. The code review and UAT (user acceptance test) could also be done with you or your representatives. Tools like UXPin and Marvel can be used to complement Figma.

Keep in mind that currently, we're not focusing outside of websites and web applications. Things like mobile (Android/iOS), AI, ML, blockchain, and data science are not our expertise yet. But we could connect you to collaborate with other partners.

## Release

1. The result is being reviewed and matched with the initial expectations.
2. The handover for:
   - Candidates or developers.
   - Technical artifacts such as design, code, software, configuration, etc.
   - Account credentials.
3. The temporary phase or grace period for consultation and maintenance.
4. The program is declared finished and successful.
5. The progress is presented and reviewed. Preferably once every 2 to 4 weeks.
